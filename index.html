    <h1 id="home" ><ins>Onion Farming</ins></h1>
    <img class="img" src="WhatsApp Image 2022-11-24 at 11.46.04.jpeg" alt="">
    
    <p>According to the Food and Agriculture Organizations (FAO) 2014 report
         50 percent of the red onions in Kenya are imported from Tanzania, making 
         the red bulb onion one of the most attractive commercial farming practices that a farmer can do.</p>

    <h4>Stages of onion growth</h4>
    <ul >
        <li>Germination</li>
        <li>Seedling</li>
        <li>Vegetative growth</li>
        <li>Bulb formation</li>
        <li>Maturation stage</li>
        <li>Harvesting</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2 class="heada">Germination:</h2>
    <img class="img" src="germination.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>The onion germination stage is the process of the onion seed 
    developing into a new onion plant.The onion germination stage can take
     anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to complete. The exact time it takes depends on several 
     factors including the temperature, the humidity and type of soil. The higher the temperature the higher the 
     humidity
     , the faster the onion germination stage will be. While the lower the temperature and the lower the humidity 
     the slower 
     the onion germination stage will be.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="heada">Seedling:</h2>
    <img class="img" src="seedling.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>During this stage, the onion plant will grow from a tiny seed into a small, green plant. 
        The onion plant will grow steadily during this stage, and it will be important to water it. That is why 
        at Kasyuma's Farm Services we have a borehole where we get our fresh water and use drip irigation to
         water the plants. The onion plant will reach its 
    full height during the seedling stage. In order to produce large, healthy bulbs, the plant must grow quickly 
    during this stage.</p>

    <h2 class="heada">Vegetative stage:</h2>
    <img class="img" src="vegatative.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>In this stage the onion plant begin to form bulbs.</p>

    <h2 class="heada">Bulb formation stage:</h2>
    <img class="img" src="bulb formation.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>The plant will form a bulb which will continue to grow in size until it is ready to harvest.</p>

    <h2 class="heada">Maturation Stage:</h2>
    <img class="img" src="Maturation.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>Onion maturation stage happens at the end of the onion's life cycle after all leaves have wilted away and gone
        brown and have fallen to the ground but not detached from the bulb.
    </p>

    <h2 class="heada">Harvesting stage:</h2>
    <img src="harvesting.jpeg" alt="" class="img">
    <p>Once the onions have reached the harvesting stage, it is time to begin the process of harvestnig them. They are
         havested by 
        uprooting them then cuting the roots and leaves. They are then sorted according to sizes and packed.
